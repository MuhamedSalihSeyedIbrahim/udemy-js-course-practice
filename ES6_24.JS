//CONST CANT BE CHANGED AND LET & VAR CAN BE CHANGED

/*
WHY LET IN ES6 ,CONSIDER THE CASE A VAR PRESENT INSIDE THE IF STATEMENT
THEN THE VAR SCOPE IS ALSO AVAILABLE OUT SIDE THE IF CASE ,INCASE THE VARIABLE
INSIDE IF WHICH IS OPEN THEN ITS SCOPE IS GLOBAL
TO AVOID THE THE LET MORE LOCALISED /SCOPED CONCEPT IS INTRODUCED IN ES 6

THE SCOPE MISBEHAVE BY VAR IS UNDER SOME STATEMENTS
IF ,IF ELSE ,IF ELSE LADDER,FOR LOOP, WHILE LOOP , DO WHILE LOOP,AND SWITCH LOOP

BUT HOWEVER IT RESPECT THE FUNCTIONAL SCOPE

//THE CONST AND LET DIFFERED BY THE VARIABLE NESS OF LET
